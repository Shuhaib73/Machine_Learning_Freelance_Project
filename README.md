### **Problem Statement:**

##### - In this project, we aim to use data analysis and machine learning to uncover valuable information from a dataset obtained from PeoplePerHour, a freelance marketplace.
##### - The dataset contains various details about freelance projects, including project descriptions, budgets, project categories, and more. Our main goals are to:
##### - Analyze the data to find meaningful patterns and insights.
##### - Utilize machine learning to make predictions and enhance decision-making.
##### - Improve our understanding of how different factors impact freelance projects on PeoplePerHour.

### **Objective:**

#### **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** 
```Gather a comprehensive dataset containing various details about freelance projects, including project descriptions, budgets, project categories, and more, ensuring data quality and addressing missing values.```
#### **Feature Selection and Engineering:** 
```Identify key features that significantly influence the Budget/Numerical feature. necessary feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive power.```
#### **Model Selection:** 
```Evaluate various machine learning algorithms(such as logistic regression, descision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, xgboost, svm and so on) to determine the best-fit model for the Budget prediction task.```
#### **Model Training and Validation:**
```Train the selected model on the dataset, utilizing appropriate techniques to ensure generalizability.```
#### **Performance Evaluation:** 
```Access the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, r2_score, precision, recall and F1-score to measure its predictive capability effectively.```

#### *In conclusion, For the Final Question : our classification model successfully predicts the value of the 'Type' column, which categorizes entries into either 'Fixed Price' (0) or 'Hourly Rate' (1) categories. The model's performance demonstrates its capability to effectively distinguish between these two pricing structures. This predictive capability holds significant value for decision-making processes, offering insights into whether a project follows a fixed or hourly pricing model.*
#### *The models evaluated are Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, Adaboost, GradientBoosting, XGBoost,Support Vector Machines (SVM), KNearestNeighbors.*
#### **Accuracy Score for Training : 99.85 % **
#### **Accuracy Score for Testing : 95.08 % **
```In summary, The XGBoost model showed the highest accuracy and performed exceptionally well in classifying both classes. It achieved the highest precision, recall, and F1-score for both class 0 and class 1.```
